# Getting Started with Terraform on Azure

This is the sooper-secret preview site for the updated Azure guide. This version covers Terraform v0.12.5 and azurerm v1.32. Samples were tested on Azure Cloud Shell, and on Azure VMs Ubuntu 18.04. VMs have Terraform and Azure CLI installed. 

Sorry, not connected to github yet, so no "edit this page" links. Coming soon!
