That concludes the getting started guide for Terraform using Azure. Hopefully
you're now able to not only see what Terraform is useful for, but
you're also able to put this knowledge to use to improve building
your own infrastructure.

<!-- Fully integrating infrastructure as code into your IT organization is beyond the scope of this guide. For more information about advanced Terraform usage in your organization, see [Terraform Recommended Practices](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/guides/recommended-practices/index.html). -->

We've covered the basics for all of these features in this guide.

As a next step, the following resources are available:

- [Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) - The documentation is an in-depth
  reference guide to all the features of Terraform, including
  technical details about the internals of how Terraform operates.

- [Examples](https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples/index.html) - The examples have more full
  featured configuration files, showing some of the possibilities
  with Terraform.

- [Import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) - The import section of the documentation
  covers importing existing infrastructure into Terraform.
